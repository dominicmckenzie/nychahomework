        <h1>More NYCHA Outages Affect Residents Even After Lawsuit, Housing Chairwoman Asks For Patience</h1>
        <h2> by K. Dominic McKenzie </h2>

  <p> Metro North Plaza Houses is just one of 8 developments affected by widespread outages in New York City today. A total of 7193 residents have been left without heat and hot water
    since yesterday, March 11. <br><br>

     One resident of Metro North, Richard Mendez, is concerned for his family's continued wellbeing. His household joined just over 2,000 apartments at the Castle Hill
    development in the Bronx who also lost their heat and hot water on Sunday.</p>

<p> "For the life of me, I cannot understand what NYCHA is doing," Mendez said. " So many people, young and old, are freezing! How many times do we need to protest before they fix it all?" <p>
<br>
      <p>Two weeks ago, the Citywide Council of Presidents filed a lawsuit against the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA)
    to get an independent monitor appointed to oversee the agency. The New York Times said residents are suing because the agency has "failed to provide heat and hot water, keep
    residents safe from lead, involve tenants in policymaking and hire residents, as required by federal regulations."</p> <br>

    <p>Alicka Ampry-Samuel, chair of the public housing committee, supports the residents.

“Sometimes it takes legal action to be heard. You could slip and fall and choose to just go to the hospital – or you can choose to sue the person that owned the place where you fell. You have a right,” she said. “Right now, NYCHA needs everyone at the table including the residents to figure out how they can fix their problems.”
