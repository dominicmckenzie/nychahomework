        <h1>More NYCHA Outages Affect Residents Even After Lawsuit, Housing Chairwoman Asks For Patience</h1>
        <p> by K. Dominic McKenzie </p>

  <p> Metro North Plaza Houses is just one of 8 developments affected by widespread outages today in New York City. 7193 residents have been left without heat and hot water
    since yesterday, March 11.</p>

        <div id="sign" class="spot" data-description= "Metro North Plaza Houses is located on 307 East 101st Street, in Upper Manhattan"></div>
        <div id="third_floor" class="spot" data-description= "Richard Mendez lives on the third floor, and has been here for three years"></div>
        <div id="total" class="spot" data-description= "Latest figures show NYCHA houses 174,526 families. In total, a whopping 401,093 residents."></div>


    <p>Two weeks ago, the Citywide Council of Presidents filed a lawsuit against the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA)
    to get an independent monitor appointed to oversee the agency. The New York Times said residents are suing because the agency has "failed to provide heat and hot water, keep
    residents safe from lead, involve tenants in policymaking and hire residents, as required by federal regulations."</p>



      <p> One resident of Metro North Plaza, Richard Mendez, is concerned for his family.</p>
